    <div class="section">
        <div class="intro">At the <span class="pink">1968 Democratic convention</span>, voters became fed up with the facade of democracy when a candidate who was not even campaigning in the primary won the party nomination.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
    <div class="slide">
      <div class="title">Democratic <span class="pink">PRETENSE</span></div>
      <div class="description">Before 1968, voters were given no control over their party's nominee. Voters tuned in to the national republican and national democrat conventions to find out who each party had nominated. The few states with primaries held them out of show--they had no effect on who got the party nomination. At the national convention, delegates voted on who would receive the party's nomination. Except back then, <span class="pink">delegates voted based on who the party bosses told them to choose.</span></div>
    </div>
    <div class="slide"><div class="title">Sparring <span class="pink">POLITICIANS</span></div>
    <div class="description">In the years leading up to the 1968 Democratic convention, there had been a growing tension between the Democratic party leadership and its young voters. The new generation of democrat voters were <span class="pink">anti-war, pro-civil rights, feminist college students</span> who felt the party leadership was out of touch with their demands. They particularly despised the incumbent president, Lyndon B. Johnson, for his support of the Vietnam War.
    </br></br>
    Young democrats threw their support behind the two anti-war senators running for president, <span class="pink">Eugene McCarthy and Robert F. Kennedy</span>. As the two senators won several primaries, Johnson ended his campaign for re-election. As the primaries came to a close, Johnson's vice president, Hubert Humphrey, made a last-minute decision to seek the nomination. He entered the race so late that he was ineligible for the remaining primaries.
</div>
    </div>
    <div class="slide"> <div class="title">DNC <span class="pink">Panic</span></div>
    <div class="description">On June 5, 1968, while giving his victory speech after winning the California primary, Kennedy was shot and killed. Without Kennedy, democrat voters rallied for McCarthy. <span class="pink">Most people assumed McCarthy would win the party nomination.</span>
    </br></br>
    At the National Democratic Convention in August, the party selected <span class="pink">Humphrey</span> as their nominee. As the pro-war candidate, Humphrey had received little popular support from democrats, and voters had not had a chance to officially express their disdain for Humphrey through the primary system. Democrats felt their party had betrayed them. They wanted an end to party bosses and back-room dealings.
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="slide"> <div class="title">Yippies <span class="pink">PROTEST</span></div>
    <div class="description">In response to the establishment Democrats, Abbie Hoffman founded the Youth International Party, known as <span class="pink">"Yippies."</span> The Yippies staged their own nominating convention, where they nominated a pig named <span class="pink">"Pigasus"</span> to represent the Democratic Party. The group brought a live pig to the protest and chanted <span class="pink">"pork power"</span> and <span class="pink">"vote pig.""</span>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="slide"> <div class="title">Reformed <span class="pink">POLICIES</span></div>
    <div class="description">
    The Democratic Party, embarrassed by the protests and the failure of Humphrey's campaign, resolved to reform their nominating process. Voters in each state vote in primaries or caucuses, then at the national party convention, delegates from that state are required to cast their ballot according to their state's results.
    </br></br>
    By 1980, democratic primaries had replaced the facade of nominee selection. Today, party national conventions are elaborate productions, <span class="pink">but the voters have already chosen the nominee.</span>
