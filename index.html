      <div class="description">Before 1968, voters were given no control over their party's nominee. Voters tuned in to the national republican and national democrat conventions to find out who each party had nominated. The few states with primaries held them out of show--they had no effect on who got the party nomination. At the national convention, delegates voted on who would receive the party's nomination. Except back then, delegates voted based on who the party bosses told them to choose.</div>

    <div class="description">In the years leading up to the 1968 Democratic convention, there had been a growing tension between the Democratic party leadership and its young voters. The new generation of democrat voters were anti-war, pro-civil rights, feminist college students who felt the party leadership was out of touch with their demands. They particularly despised the incumbent president, Lyndon B. Johnson, for his support of the Vietnam War.
    </br></br>
    Young democrats threw their support behind the two anti-war senators running for president, Eugene McCarthy and Robert F. Kennedy. As the two senators won several primaries, Johnson ended his campaign for re-election. As the primaries came to a close, Johnsonâ€™s vice president, Hubert Humphrey, made a last-minute decision to seek the nomination. He entered the race so late that he was ineligible for the remaining primaries.
